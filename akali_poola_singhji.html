        <p>Akali Phoola Singh was a legendary Sikh warrior and commander of the Sikh Khalsa Army during Maharaja Ranjit Singh's rule. He was known for his bravery, discipline, and commitment to Sikh principles. He played a crucial role in expanding the Sikh Empire and leading successful military campaigns against Afghan invaders.
