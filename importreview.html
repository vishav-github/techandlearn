        <h2>Import Reviews with Sample</h2>
        <p>Maybe some of you are already aware of this functionality, but this is what I investigated today. Last time, we couldn't figure out how to import historical data and link all imported reviews with relevant sample records.</p>

        <p>I would like to share with you the feasibility to import reviews with sample details. In this way, imported reviews will be linked with sample records. The steps are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Import an empty sample just to create a column structure.</li>
            <li>Create a survey and link it with the sample.</li>
            <li>Create an import profile, edit profile data, and then link it with the survey at the bottom.</li>
            <li>After editing profile data, open it again, and you will see the sample columns at the bottom of the page.</li>
            <li>Define the sample column names as we do for questions.</li>
            <li>Use the same Excel file for reviews and sample records.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>See attached Excel file</strong> that contains reviews and sample details.</p>
        <p><strong>See imported reviews</strong> that are linked with samples.</p>

        <h2>Import Profile</h2>
        <p>Check the import profile: <a href="https://eu.checker-soft.com/testing/import-profile-edit.php?ProfileID=126&msg=Changes%20saved!" target="_blank">View Import Profile</a></p>
